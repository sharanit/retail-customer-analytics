# Project Summary

## Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis
**Statistical Inference Project using Confidence Intervals and Central Limit Theorem**

---

## 🎯 Project at a Glance

**Type:** Data Science / Statistical Analysis  
**Domain:** Retail Analytics  
**Methodology:** Inferential Statistics, Hypothesis Testing  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy  
**Dataset:** ~550K Black Friday retail transactions  

---

## 📊 Business Context

A major retail corporation serving 100M+ customers wants to understand:
- Do different demographic segments spend differently?
- Can we statistically validate these differences?
- How can we use these insights for business strategy?

---

## 🔬 Technical Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data quality assessment
- Missing value detection and handling
- Outlier analysis
- Distribution analysis
- Correlation studies

### 2. Statistical Inference
- **Confidence Intervals** at 90%, 95%, 99% levels
- **Central Limit Theorem** demonstration
- **Hypothesis Testing** (t-tests, ANOVA)
- **Effect Size** calculations

### 3. Comparative Analysis
Spending patterns across:
- **Gender:** Male vs Female
- **Marital Status:** Married vs Unmarried
- **Age Groups:** 0-17, 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51+

---

## 📈 Key Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook** - Complete analysis with code and visualizations
2. **Statistical Reports** - Confidence intervals and hypothesis test results
3. **Visualizations** - Distribution plots, boxplots, CI comparisons
4. **Business Recommendations** - Actionable insights for stakeholders
5. **Reusable Code** - Modular Python functions for future analyses

---

## 💡 Key Insights (Example)

> **Note:** Actual insights depend on the data analysis results

Example findings might include:
- Male customers spend X% more on average (95% CI: [a, b])
- Confidence intervals overlap/don't overlap → Statistical significance
- Age group 26-35 shows highest average spending
- Married customers spend differently than unmarried
- Sample size impact on estimation precision
